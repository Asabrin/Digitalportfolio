                                                     PORTFOLIO

                             Portfolio  is  partly  based  on  the  Latin  folium,  meaning
                             "leaf,  sheet". A  portfolio  usually  represents  a  portable
                             showcase  of   your  talents.  Today  actual  portfolios  are
                             used  less  than  they  used  to   be  by  artists,  since  most
                             commercial   artists   have   a   website  dedicated  to  the
                             showing  off   their  art.  But   portfolio  in  its   other   a
                             common.  meaning  is  extremely  common.  Not  so  long
                             ago,  a  broker   would  keep  each  of  his   or  her   clients'
                             investments   in  a  separate  notebook  or  portfolio.  Today
                             the  investment  portfolio,  like  an  artist's  portfolio,   it
                             usually   takes  the  form  of  a  web  page,  even  though 
                             everyone  still   uses   the   same  old   word.
